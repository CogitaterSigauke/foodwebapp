Bug Tracking System: Github Issues

We are using Github Issues for tracking bugs in our project. As we are collaborating using github, Github Issues will be manageable for us to track, report, and fix bugs in our code. Collaborators may report issues to our Github repository so that the person assigned to do the task can easily track the reported issue and fix it.

Steps to be followed when collaborators find issues and want to report them:

# Step one: 
      Navigate to the main page of our github project’s repository as shown in the image below
