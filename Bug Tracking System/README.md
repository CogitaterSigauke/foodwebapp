Bug Tracking System: Github Issues

We are using Github Issues for tracking bugs in our project. As we are collaborating using github, Github Issues will be manageable for us to track, report, and fix bugs in our code. Collaborators may report issues to our Github repository so that the person assigned to do the task can easily track the reported issue and fix it.

Steps to be followed when collaborators find issues and want to report them:

      •	Navigate to the main page of our github project’s repository.
                ![mainpage](CogitaterSigauke/foodwebapp/Bug Tracking System/mainpage.jpg)
      
      •	Under our project’s repository name, click on Issues tab.
      
      •	Click New Issue.
      
      •	Type the title and write a detailed description of the issue. Our team highly recommends each team member to take a screenshot of the issue and attach it to the ‘Leave a comment’ text area.
      
      •	Before submitting the issue, team members are required to assign the issue to someone and label the issue. 
      
      •	Click submit.
