Ingredients

3 cups water
 
6 eaches chicken drumsticks, or more to taste
 
1 large yellow onion, sliced into rings, divided
 
2 Scotch bonnet chile peppers, chopped, divided
 
1 clove garlic, divided
 
1 teaspoon salt
 
1 teaspoon ground black pepper to taste
 
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
 
2 eaches green bell peppers, chopped
 
2 green onions
 
1 teaspoon oregano
 
1 teaspoon paprika
 
1 (15 ounce) can stewed tomatoes, divided
 
2 fresh tomatoes, chopped



Instructions
 
 Step 1
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

 Step 2
Place water and chicken in a large pot. Add one third the onion rings, 1 chile pepper, one third the garlic, salt, and black pepper. Cook over medium heat until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes; drain water. Transfer mixture to a glass casserole dish.

 Step 3
Place remaining chile pepper, remaining garlic, tomato sauce, green bell peppers, green onions, oregano, and paprika in a blender. Blend into a smooth sauce. Add another third onion rings and 1/2 can stewed tomatoes to the blender; blend sauce until smooth.

 Step 4
Pour sauce over chicken in the casserole dish. Add remaining stewed tomatoes, remaining onion rings, and fresh tomatoes; mix. Cover with aluminum foil.

 Step 5
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, turning the chicken every 5 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and cook, uncovered, until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
